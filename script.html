<p>Welcome. My name is _____, and I'm here on behalf of the Super Cool Market Research Agency.</p><br>

<p>Today, we’re going to be talking about online courses at Penn. We know since the start of the pandemic, you have all had the experience of taking online classes, and we're interested in learning more about your experiences. But first, let’s start by introducing ourselves. We'll go around, and have each person introduce themself: tell us your name, what year you're in, and your major.</p><br>

<p><i>[pause for discussion]</i></p><br>

<p>First, just by a show of hands (using the Zoom raise hands feature), how many of you are less likely to attend an online lecture than an in-person one?</p><br>
	
<p><i>[count the hands]</i></p><br>

<p>Now, to get everyone thinking: if you had to describe your experience with online learning using just one word, what would it be? Let's go around and hear from everyone.</p><br>

<p><i>[ask each person]</i></p><br>

<p>The reason we are here today is that professors have noticed that students seem to be coming to live lectures less often, and we want to understand why. To get into that issue, let's start by exploring why you do or do not go to lectures: for those of you who raised your hands before, what is the biggest reason why you are less likely to attend live lectures? For those of you who didn't raise your hands, why do you still participate in live lectures?</p><br>

<p><i>[pause for discussion; follow the guidelines!]</i></p><br>

<p>Regardless of whether you raised your hand or not, what is one thing you think makes an online lecture engaging?</p><br>
