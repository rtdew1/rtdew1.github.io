                    <strong>Research Overview:</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am an applied methodologist, interested in the intersection of modern probabilistic machine
                    learning and marketing. I focus on problems in customer analytics, preference measurement, and
                    design, with an eye to developing and applying flexible, interpretable, computational tools to drive
                    insights in these domains. I also study how rich, unstructured data like text and images can be used
                    in classic data-driven marketing contexts, like preference measurement, and in contexts which
                    previously have been difficult to study from a data-driven perspective, like branding and design.
                    Methodologically, I am interested in Bayesian nonparametrics, Bayesian computation, deep generative
                    models, and representation learning. I'm honored to have received several awards for my research,
                    including the 2022 Frank M. Bass Award, the 2018 INFORMS Society for Marketing Science Doctoral
                    Dissertation Award, and the 2018 Marketing Section of the American Statistical Association's 
                    Doctoral Research Award. Several of my papers have also been finalists for the Frank M. Bass and 
                    Paul Green Awards.

                                <blockquote>Modern marketers are responsible for understanding and managing customer
                                    spending behavior across many different products. Dynamics in spending result from
                                    both predictable customer-level effects, which are characterized by interpurchase
                                    time, customer lifetime, and past purchase frequency, as well as calendar time
                                    effects, which are driven by managerial actions such as product changes and
                                    promotions, and by general trends and random shocks. Understanding these dynamics in
                                    spending is further complicated by a lack of knowledge of all of the factors that
                                    influence spending for a given product, a problem exacerbated in large multiproduct
                                    firms by information asymmetries that can exist between the product teams that
                                    execute marketing actions and the marketing analytics team responsible for customer
                                    base analysis. A comprehensive understanding of customer base dynamics therefore
                                    requires a modeling framework that flexibly integrates both known and unknown
                                    calendar time determinants of spending with the individual-level effects that
                                    robustly predict spend activity. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric
                                    framework based on Gaussian process priors to understand and predict customer
                                    spending. Our model separates out calendar time effects from individual-level
                                    dynamics by modeling both sets of factors as unknown latent functions that jointly
                                    determine spend propensity. The primary output of our Gaussian Process Propensity
                                    Model (GPPM) is a set of estimated curves that provides a visual and easily
                                    comprehensible representation of purchasing dynamics, which we call the model-based
                                    dashboard. We illustrate the utility of our modeling framework on data from two
                                    popular free-to-play mobile video games. We show how the GPPM's model-based
                                    dashboard can be useful for assessing patterns and disruptions in spending. We also
                                    show how the GPPM exhibits superior forecasting ability compared to existing
                                    customer base analysis benchmarks, including hazard and buy-till-you-die models.

                                <blockquote>
                                    Marketing research relies on individual-level estimates to understand the rich
                                    heterogeneity that exists in consumers, firms, and products. While much of the
                                    literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional heterogeneity, little
                                    research has been done on modeling dynamic heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous
                                    evolution of individual-level model parameters. In this work, we propose a novel
                                    framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level,
                                    latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity
                                    specifications, our Gaussian Process Dynamic Heterogeneity (GPDH) specification
                                    models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level
                                    trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and
                                    within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise
                                    individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. We show that GPDH nests
                                    existing heterogeneity specifications, and that not flexibly capturing
                                    individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively,
                                    we apply GPDH to two problems: understanding preference dynamics, and modeling the
                                    evolution of online reviews. Across both applications, we find robust evidence of
                                    dynamic heterogeneity, and illustrate GPDH's rich managerial insights, with
                                    implications for targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.

                                <blockquote>Logos serve a fundamental role in branding as the visual figurehead of the
                                    brand. Yet, due to the difficulty of using unstructured image data, prior research
                                    on logo design has been largely limited to non-quantitative studies. In this work,
                                    we explore logo design from a data-driven perspective. In particular, we aim to
                                    answer several key questions: first, to what degree can logos represent a brand's
                                    personality? Second, what are the key visual elements in logos that elicit brand and
                                    firm relevant associations, such as brand personality traits? Finally, given text
                                    describing a firm's brand or function, can we suggest features of a logo that elicit
                                    the firm's desired image? To answer these questions, we develop a novel logo feature
                                    extraction algorithm, that uses modern image processing tools to decompose
                                    unstructured pixel-level image data into meaningful visual features. We then analyze
                                    the links between firm identity and the features of logos through a deep, multiview
                                    generative model, which links visual features of logos with textual descriptions of
                                    firms and consumer ratings of brand personality by learning representations of brand
                                    identity. We apply our modeling framework on a dataset of hundreds of logos, textual
                                    descriptions from firms' websites, third party descriptions of firms, and consumer
                                    evaluations of brand personality to explore these questions.</blockquote>

                                    Routines shape many aspects of day-to-day consumption. While prior work has established 
                                    the importance of habits in consumer behavior, little work has been done to understand 
                                    the implications of routines —- which we define as repeated behaviors with recurring, 
                                    temporal structures —- for customer management. One reason for this dearth is the difficulty 
                                    of measuring routines from transaction data, particularly when routines vary substantially 
                                    across customers. We propose a new approach for doing so, which we apply in the context of 
                                    ridesharing. We model customer-level routines with Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian 
                                    processes (GPs), leveraging a novel kernel that allows for flexible yet precise estimation 
                                    of routines. These GPs are nested in inhomogeneous Poisson processes of usage, allowing us 
                                    to estimate customers' routines, and decompose their usage into routine and non-routine 
                                    parts. We show the value of detecting routines for customer relationship management (CRM) 
                                    in the context of ridesharing, where we find that routines are associated with higher 
                                    future usage and activity rates, and more resilience to service failures. Moreover, we 
                                    show how these outcomes vary by the types of routines customers have, and by whether 
                                    trips are part of the customer's routine, suggesting a role for routines in segmentation 
                                    and targeting.

                                Despite the explosive growth of influencer marketing, wherein companies sponsor social
                                media personalities to promote their brands, there is little research to guide
                                companies’ selection of influencer partners. One common criterion is popularity: while
                                some firms sponsor “mega” influencers with millions of followers, other firms partner
                                with “micro” influencers, who may only have several thousands of followers, but may also
                                cost less to sponsor. To quantify this trade-off between reach and cost, we develop a
                                framework for estimating the follower elasticity of impressions, or FEI, which measures
                                a video’s percentage gain in impressions corresponding to a percentage increase in the
                                follower size of its creator. Computing FEI involves estimating the causal effect of an
                                influencer’s popularity on the view counts of their videos, which we achieve through a
                                combination of a unique dataset collected from TikTok, a representation learning model
                                for quantifying video content, and a machine learning-based causal inference method. We
                                find that FEI is always positive, but often nonlinearly related to follower size,
                                suggesting different optimal sponsorship strategies than those observed in practice. We
                                examine the factors that predict variation in these FEI curves, and show how firms can
                                use these results to better determine influencer partnerships.

                                Understanding individual customers’ sensitivities to prices, promotions, brand, and
                                other aspects of the marketing mix is fundamental to a wide swath of marketing problems,
                                including targeting and pricing. Companies that operate across many product categories
                                have a unique opportunity, insofar as they can use purchasing data from one category to
                                augment their insights in another. Such cross-category insights are especially crucial
                                in situations where purchasing data may be rich in one category, and scarce in another.
                                An important aspect of how consumers behave across categories is dynamics: preferences
                                are not stable over time, and changes in individual-level preference parameters in one
                                category may be indicative of changes in other categories, especially if those changes
                                are driven by external factors. Yet, despite the rich history of modeling cross-category
                                preferences, the marketing literature lacks a framework that flexibly accounts for
                                correlated dynamics, or the cross-category interlinkages of individual-level sensitivity
                                dynamics. In this work, we propose such a framework, leveraging individual-level,
                                latent, multi-output Gaussian processes to build a nonparametric Bayesian choice model
                                that allows information sharing of preference parameters across customers, time, and
                                categories. We apply our model to grocery purchase data, and show that our model detects
                                interesting dynamics of customers’ price sensitivities across multiple categories.
                                Managerially, we show that capturing correlated dynamics yields substantial predictive
                                gains, relative to benchmarks. Moreover, we find that capturing correlated dynamics can
                                have implications for understanding changes in consumers preferences over time, and
                                developing targeted marketing strategies based on those dynamics.

                                A common problem in recommendation engines is the cold start problem: how can we make a
                                recommendation to a new customer, without any prior purchase data? Such problems are
                                particularly salient for increasingly common online subscription businesses, where
                                initial recommendations can shape whether potential customers decide to subscribe, and
                                how their preferences evolve subsequently. The need to assess a new customers'
                                preferences quickly, and without prior purchase data, has led to the increasing
                                prevalence of customer onboarding surveys, wherein companies ask potential or current
                                customers a series of questions aimed at understanding their preferences, without having
                                observed any purchasing. While such onboarding surveys are a relatively recent
                                development in e-commerce, the idea of learning the most information about a customer’s
                                preferences as possible using the fewest questions has been studied extensively in
                                “offline” marketing research, in the context of adaptive conjoint analysis. In this
                                work, I bridge these two domains using a combination of representation learning for
                                unstructured data, and Bayesian optimization for on-the-fly estimation of preferences. I
                                apply this framework both in the context of an on-boarding survey for an online
                                subscription business, and in the context of traditional preference measurement.

							<div id="hostel" style="display:none;"><blockquote>	Despite the recent surge in popularity of free cancellation programs across many business settings, the impact of a free cancellation program on customers’ behavior and firm profits remains unclear. Previous research has found that the implementation of a free cancellation program encourages customers to repeat purchase more frequently, spend more on each trip, but also cancel their reservations more often. However, we do not know the relative magnitude of each effect, or which may dominate in terms of the overall impact on firm profit. We investigate this question empirically using data from a hostel booking platform, and a Bayesian semiparametric model that lets us nonparametrically decompose the impact of the free cancellation on customers’ repeat booking propensity, booking timing, spend and cancellation amounts, and propensity to churn. Our model combines both Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes to assess intertemporal effects of the program, and Dirichlet processes to capture the rich heterogeneity that exists in this setting. We find that the effect of the program on existing customers varies tremendously across different customer segments, with muted short-run effects for loyal customers, but strong, positive CLV implications. Ultimately, we find the program was beneficial for the platform.

The flexibility of the proposed architecture allows for easy and scalable fusion of user, game, and decision context static and dynamic covariates across data types, such as user game-playing behavior, textual game descriptions, social media data like Reddit comments, and seasonal events.</blockquote></div></li><br>

            <div id="4" style="display:none;"><blockquote>Marketers face a deluge of data on all aspects of their customers, including what they are buying, how they are using their products, and what they are saying about their purchases. We seek to address the problem of understanding general patterns across many modes of customer behavior, by modeling consumers through a set of latent, inferred personas that are related to behaviors across all domains of interest. Our customer-centric approach allows firms to leverage data across domains, even in the presence of missing data, to better understand and predict customer behavior in any particular domain, using existing probabilistic models of customer behavior. We illustrate the expressive capacity and managerial utility of such a framework through an application to rental car transaction and textual feedback data.<br><br>This work was a winner of the Deming Center's 2016 Doctoral Fellowship.</blockquote></div></li><br> -->
