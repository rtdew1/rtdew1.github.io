                    <strong>Research Overview:</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am an applied methodologist, interested in the intersection of modern probabilistic machine
                    learning and marketing. I focus on problems in customer analytics, preference measurement, and
                    design, with an eye to developing and applying flexible, interpretable, computational tools to drive
                    insights in these domains. I also study how rich, unstructured data like text and images can be used
                    in classic data-driven marketing contexts, like preference measurement, and in contexts which
                    previously have been difficult to study from a data-driven perspective, like branding and design.
                    Methodologically, I am interested in Bayesian nonparametrics, Bayesian computation, deep generative
                    models, and representation learning. I'm honored to have received several awards for my research,
                    including the 2022 Frank M. Bass Award, the 2018 INFORMS Society for Marketing Science Doctoral
                    Dissertation Award, and the 2018 Marketing Section of the American Statistical Association's 
                    Doctoral Research Award. My papers have also been finalists for the John D.C. Little Award and Paul Green Awards. In recognition of my research, I was named a 2023 MSI Young Scholar. I have been the Govil Family Faculty Scholar at the Wharton School since 2024.

                                <blockquote>Modern marketers are responsible for understanding and managing customer
                                    spending behavior across many different products. Dynamics in spending result from
                                    both predictable customer-level effects, which are characterized by interpurchase
                                    time, customer lifetime, and past purchase frequency, as well as calendar time
                                    effects, which are driven by managerial actions such as product changes and
                                    promotions, and by general trends and random shocks. Understanding these dynamics in
                                    spending is further complicated by a lack of knowledge of all of the factors that
                                    influence spending for a given product, a problem exacerbated in large multiproduct
                                    firms by information asymmetries that can exist between the product teams that
                                    execute marketing actions and the marketing analytics team responsible for customer
                                    base analysis. A comprehensive understanding of customer base dynamics therefore
                                    requires a modeling framework that flexibly integrates both known and unknown
                                    calendar time determinants of spending with the individual-level effects that
                                    robustly predict spend activity. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric
                                    framework based on Gaussian process priors to understand and predict customer
                                    spending. Our model separates out calendar time effects from individual-level
                                    dynamics by modeling both sets of factors as unknown latent functions that jointly
                                    determine spend propensity. The primary output of our Gaussian Process Propensity
                                    Model (GPPM) is a set of estimated curves that provides a visual and easily
                                    comprehensible representation of purchasing dynamics, which we call the model-based
                                    dashboard. We illustrate the utility of our modeling framework on data from two
                                    popular free-to-play mobile video games. We show how the GPPM's model-based
                                    dashboard can be useful for assessing patterns and disruptions in spending. We also
                                    show how the GPPM exhibits superior forecasting ability compared to existing
                                    customer base analysis benchmarks, including hazard and buy-till-you-die models.

                                <blockquote>
                                    Marketing research relies on individual-level estimates to understand the rich
                                    heterogeneity that exists in consumers, firms, and products. While much of the
                                    literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional heterogeneity, little
                                    research has been done on modeling dynamic heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous
                                    evolution of individual-level model parameters. In this work, we propose a novel
                                    framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level,
                                    latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity
                                    specifications, our Gaussian Process Dynamic Heterogeneity (GPDH) specification
                                    models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level
                                    trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and
                                    within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise
                                    individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. We show that GPDH nests
                                    existing heterogeneity specifications, and that not flexibly capturing
                                    individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively,
                                    we apply GPDH to two problems: understanding preference dynamics, and modeling the
                                    evolution of online reviews. Across both applications, we find robust evidence of
                                    dynamic heterogeneity, and illustrate GPDH's rich managerial insights, with
                                    implications for targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.

                                <blockquote>Logos serve a fundamental role in branding as the visual figurehead of the
                                    brand. Yet, due to the difficulty of using unstructured image data, prior research
                                    on logo design has been largely limited to non-quantitative studies. In this work,
                                    we explore logo design from a data-driven perspective. In particular, we aim to
                                    answer several key questions: first, to what degree can logos represent a brand's
                                    personality? Second, what are the key visual elements in logos that elicit brand and
                                    firm relevant associations, such as brand personality traits? Finally, given text
                                    describing a firm's brand or function, can we suggest features of a logo that elicit
                                    the firm's desired image? To answer these questions, we develop a novel logo feature
                                    extraction algorithm, that uses modern image processing tools to decompose
                                    unstructured pixel-level image data into meaningful visual features. We then analyze
                                    the links between firm identity and the features of logos through a deep, multiview
                                    generative model, which links visual features of logos with textual descriptions of
                                    firms and consumer ratings of brand personality by learning representations of brand
                                    identity. We apply our modeling framework on a dataset of hundreds of logos, textual
                                    descriptions from firms' websites, third party descriptions of firms, and consumer
                                    evaluations of brand personality to explore these questions.</blockquote>

                                    Routines shape many aspects of day-to-day consumption. While prior work has established 
                                    the importance of habits in consumer behavior, little work has been done to understand 
                                    the implications of routines —- which we define as repeated behaviors with recurring, 
                                    temporal structures —- for customer management. One reason for this dearth is the difficulty 
                                    of measuring routines from transaction data, particularly when routines vary substantially 
                                    across customers. We propose a new approach for doing so, which we apply in the context of 
                                    ridesharing. We model customer-level routines with Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian 
                                    processes (GPs), leveraging a novel kernel that allows for flexible yet precise estimation 
                                    of routines. These GPs are nested in inhomogeneous Poisson processes of usage, allowing us 
                                    to estimate customers' routines, and decompose their usage into routine and non-routine 
                                    parts. We show the value of detecting routines for customer relationship management (CRM) 
                                    in the context of ridesharing, where we find that routines are associated with higher 
                                    future usage and activity rates, and more resilience to service failures. Moreover, we 
                                    show how these outcomes vary by the types of routines customers have, and by whether 
                                    trips are part of the customer's routine, suggesting a role for routines in segmentation 
                                    and targeting.

                                Despite the explosive growth of influencer marketing, wherein companies sponsor social
                                media personalities to promote their brands, there is little research to guide
                                companies' selection of influencer partners. One common criterion is popularity: while
                                some firms sponsor “mega” influencers with millions of followers, other firms partner
                                with “micro” influencers, who may only have several thousands of followers, but may also
                                cost less to sponsor. To quantify this trade-off between reach and cost, we develop a
                                framework for estimating the follower elasticity of impressions, or FEI, which measures
                                a video’s percentage gain in impressions corresponding to a percentage increase in the
                                follower size of its creator. Computing FEI involves estimating the causal effect of an
                                influencer’s popularity on the view counts of their videos, which we achieve through a
                                combination of a unique dataset collected from TikTok, a representation learning model
                                for quantifying video content, and a machine learning-based causal inference method. We
                                find that FEI is always positive, but often nonlinearly related to follower size,
                                suggesting different optimal sponsorship strategies than those observed in practice. We
                                examine the factors that predict variation in these FEI curves, and show how firms can
                                use these results to better determine influencer partnerships.

                                Many products are most meaningfully described using unstructured data like text or images. Unstructured data are also common in e-commerce, where products are often described by photos and text, but not with standardized sets of attributes. While much is known about how to efficiently measure consumer preferences when products can be meaningfully described by structured attributes, there is scant research on doing the same for unstructured data. This paper introduces a real-time, adaptive survey design framework for measuring preferences over unstructured data, leveraging Bayesian optimization. By adaptively choosing items to display based on uncertainty around a nonparametric utility model, the proposed method maximizes information gain per question, enabling quick estimation of individual-level preferences. The approach operates on embeddings of the unstructured data, thereby eliminating the requirement for manual coding of product attributes. We apply the method to measuring preferences over clothing, and highlight its potential both for the general task of marketing research, and for the specific task of designing customer onboarding surveys to mitigate the cold-start recommendation problem. We also develop methods for interpreting the nonparametric utility functions, which allow us to reconstruct consumer valuations of discrete attributes, even for attributes that were not considered or available a priori.

	                                Making sense of massive, individual-level data is challenging: marketing researchers and analysts need flexible models that can accommodate rich patterns of heterogeneity and dynamics, work with and link diverse data types, and scale to modern data sizes. Practitioners also need tools that can quantify uncertainty in models and predictions of consumer behavior to inform optimal decision-making. In this paper, we demonstrate the promise of probabilistic machine learning (PML), which refers to the pairing of probabilistic modeling and machine learning methods, in pushing the frontier of combining flexibility, scalability, interpretability, and uncertainty quantification for building better models of consumers and their choices. Specifically, we overview both PML models and inference methods, and highlight their utility for addressing four common classes of marketing problems: (1) uncovering heterogeneity, (2) flexibly modeling nonlinearities and dynamics, (3) handling high-dimensional and unstructured data, and (4) addressing missingness, often via data fusion. We also discuss promising directions in enriching marketing models, reflecting recent developments in representation learning, causal inference, experimentation and decision-making, and theory-based behavioral modeling.

	                                Customer preferences for brands, prices, and other marketing mix elements vary over time, differ across individuals, and can be correlated across product categories. Leveraging these correlations allows data-rich categories to improve insights in sparser ones. Yet, while methods exist for modeling static cross-category correlations and single-category dynamics, none model correlated preference dynamics across categories. To fill this gap, the authors develop a Hierarchical Dynamic Factor (HDF) model that captures such correlated dynamics. HDF represents preference parameters via heterogeneous weights on common cross-category dynamic latent factors, estimated using Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes, enabling precise individual-level predictions of evolving preferences. Applying HDF to grocery purchase data reveals that preference changes are indeed correlated across categories, and that modeling these correlations improves pricing and targeting decisions.

	                                Recent years have seen a resurgence in interest in marketing mix models (MMMs), which are aggregate-level models of marketing effectiveness. Often these models incorporate nonlinear effects, and either implicitly or explicitly assume dynamic, or time-varying, effects. In this paper, we show that nonlinear and dynamic effects are often not identifiable from standard marketing mix data: while certain data patterns may be suggestive of nonlinear effects, such patterns may also emerge under simpler models that incorporate dynamics in marketing effectiveness. This lack of identification is problematic because nonlinearities and dynamics suggest fundamentally different optimal marketing allocations. We examine this identification issue through theory and simulations, wherein we explore the exact conditions under which conflation between the two types of models is likely to occur. In doing so, we introduce a flexible Bayesian nonparametric model that allows us to both flexibly simulate and estimate different data generating processes. We show that conflating the two types of effects is especially likely in the presence of autocorrelated marketing variables, which is common in practice, especially given the common use of stock variables to capturing long-run effects of advertising. We illustrate these ideas through numerous empirical applications to real-world marketing mix data, showing the prevalence of the conflation issue in practice. Finally, we show how marketers can avoid this conflation, by designing experiments that strategically manipulate spending in ways that pin down model form.
